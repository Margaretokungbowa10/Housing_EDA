# Housing EDA Project

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to understand the relationships between various features and the median value of owner-occupied homes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `housing.csv`, containing information on 14 features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate, and proximity to the Charles River.

**Key features include:**
- **CRIM:** Per capita crime rate by town  
- **ZN:** Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots  
- **INDUS:** Proportion of non-retail business acres  
- **CHAS:** Charles River bounds (1 if tract bounds river, 0 otherwise)  
- **RM:** Average number of rooms per dwelling  
- **AGE:** Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940  
- **DIS:** Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers  
- **RAD:** Index of accessibility to radial highways  
- **TAX:** Full-value property tax rate per $10,000  
- **PTRATIO:** Pupil-teacher ratio by town  
- **B:** 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is proportion of blacks by town  
- **LSTAT:** Percentage lower status of the population  
- **MEDV:** Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

## What I Did
- Checked **data types**, **missing values**, and **basic statistics**.  
- Cleaned and renamed columns for better readability.  
- Created **histograms** to understand distribution of numeric features.  
- Generated a **correlation heatmap** to explore relationships between variables.  
- Made **scatter plots** and **boxplots** to visualize relationships and distributions.
